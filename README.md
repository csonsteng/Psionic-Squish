# Psionic-Squish
This is my large scale personal game project; however at the time of writing this I haven't worked on it in 6 months or so. I got it to the point of pseudo-vertical slice, took a break, and haven't really delved back into it.

It is inspired heavily by one of my all-time favorite games, Invisible Inc. However, rather than cyberpunk themed it draws heavily from my background as a D&D dungeon master and utilizes fantasy elements.

The story of the game (while not yet explained in build) is that there is Queen Squish with psionic powers who has taken control over most of civilization (akin to mind-flayers). You are a part of the rebel faction and have actually developed psionic powers yourself; however yours require consent of the individual. You use your powers to lead squads of Squishs on an assault agains the Queen.
